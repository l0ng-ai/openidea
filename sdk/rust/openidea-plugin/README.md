# Rust plugin SDK

The Rust API is documented by `cargo doc`. Web pages shipped alongside a Rust
component use `window.openidea` rather than Rust imports.

API 1.3 adds capability-gated interactive PTYs to that web bridge. Declare
`engines.openidea = "^1.3"` and `process:<program>` in `plugin.toml`, then send
`pty-spawn`, `pty-input`, `pty-resize` and `pty-kill` JSON strings using
`openidea.postMessage`. Consume `pty-data` and acknowledge its `sequence` using
`pty-ack`; handle `pty-exit` and `pty-error` through `openidea.onMessage`.

See [the protocol, permission and resource limits](../../../plugins/README.md#web-frame-ptys-api-13)
and the [minimal fixture](../../../crates/ide-plugin/tests/fixtures/web-pty).
The frame cannot access IPC directly. Its sessions belong to that frame and
end with its view or plugin. There is no new WIT import for this API.

API 1.3 also adds `open-log-tab` to the web bridge: a generic read-only editor
tab streams output from a granted process, with plugin-defined argument toggles.
It uses the same backend authorization and bounded PTY transport. See the
[protocol and lifecycle](../../../plugins/README.md#streaming-log-editor-tabs-api-13)
and the [built fixture](../../../crates/ide-plugin/tests/fixtures/web-log).
